  Universal habits for building with an AI agent: small iterations, verification, lean domain skills instead of long prompts, and keeping stack concerns separate. For any language, framework, or API. Use when vibe coding, scoping work, or keeping an agent disciplined—not for library-specific API signatures (use a domain skill or official docs for those).

# Vibe coding

**Vibe coding** means you steer; the agent helps you ship. You do not need to master everything upfront—you need **tight loops**, **honest checks**, and **the right small context** at the right time. This applies to any project.

## Habits

1. **Slice** the smallest shippable change. One feature, one failure mode, one screen—whatever keeps the next step obvious.
2. **Implement** with the **right reference** in view: a project skill, framework docs, or an official API page—not a wall of ad-hoc rules in the chat.
3. **Verify** before you call it done: run tests, a script, a linter, or a reproduction the user can repeat. If nothing ran, say what should run.
4. **Iterate**. Avoid giant diffs that mix auth, UI, and data in one go unless the user asked for that explicitly.

## Skills vs. long prompts

- Prefer a **short domain skill** (or a link to a canonical doc) over pasting the same long instructions every session.
- If the agent keeps guessing a library’s API, **read the current docs** (or a dedicated skill) instead of improvising from training data.

## Ecosystem: separate your layers

- **App and UX** (framework, components, a11y, design, routing): use skills or docs for *that* layer. Browsable examples include [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) and whatever your team ships.
- **Data and APIs** (databases, HTTP clients, model/speech/translation providers): use **that product’s** official reference or a provider-specific skill. Do not copy example HTTP calls from a UI skill into your real client without matching them to the real spec.
- **Model, speech, translation, or vision** features: treat them like any other API—**vendor docs and provider skills** win over generic chat guesses.

## Gotchas

| Issue | What to do |
|-------|------------|
| Stale or invented APIs | Open the **current** project docs or provider documentation; do not trust memory alone. |
| One skill’s example bleeding into the wrong layer | A React skill’s `fetch` snippet is not automatically your model API—reconcile with the right spec. |
| Pasting a novel into every request | Shrink to a skill, a doc link, or a few bullets; refresh when the library changes. |
| “Big bang” refactors | Split, verify, repeat. |
