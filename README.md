## About

LLMs have fixed knowledge from their training cutoff. Sarvam AI's SDK has unique patterns that differ from standard conventions — method names that break expectations (`client.text.translate()` not `client.translate.translate()`), parameters that silently fail (`output_script` on sarvam-translate), and response quirks (`content` being `None` when reasoning consumes the token budget).

These skills bridge that gap. Each one gives AI coding assistants the exact SDK signatures and gotchas they need to generate correct Sarvam AI code, then routes to [llms.txt](https://docs.sarvam.ai/llms.txt) for detailed documentation.

For **in-chat** Sarvam actions (translate this, speak that, dub audio) across Cursor, Claude Code, and other MCP clients, install [sarvam-mcp](https://github.com/sarvamai/sarvam-mcp) and use the [sarvam-mcp](./sarvam-mcp) skill.

## Skills

The [vibe-coding](./vibe-coding) skill is **stack- and vendor-agnostic**—it is for anyone building with an agent. [sarvam-mcp](./sarvam-mcp) teaches agents to drive the Sarvam MCP server in any harness. The other skills document **Sarvam** SDK APIs for writing code.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [sarvam-mcp](./sarvam-mcp) | **MCP (any harness)** — route `sarvam_tools_*` (runtime) vs `sarvam_code_*` (build-time), auth, workflows (voice/dub/localize/recall), and client install. Use when Sarvam MCP is connected or the user wants live STT/TTS/translate in chat. |
| [chat](./chat) | Chat completions with Sarvam-105B/30B. Python & JS/TS quick starts, streaming, reasoning mode, OpenAI-compatible path, and the `content=None` gotcha. |
| [speech-to-text](./speech-to-text) | Audio transcription with Saaras v3. Python & JS/TS quick starts, Batch API (long audio + diarization), and WebSocket streaming for 23 languages. |
| [text-to-speech](./text-to-speech) | Speech synthesis with Bulbul v3. Python & JS/TS quick starts, HTTP stream, WebSocket, pronunciation dictionaries, and unsupported parameter warnings. |
| [translate](./translate) | Text translation with Sarvam-Translate v1 and Mayura v1. Python & JS/TS quick starts, model feature differences, and silent parameter failures. |
| [voice-agents](./voice-agents) | Real-time voice agents with LiveKit and Pipecat (Python). JS/TS SDK reference for custom pipelines. |
| [vibe-coding](./vibe-coding) | **Vendor-neutral** vibe coding: small steps, verification, skills over long prompts, and separating UI from API layers. For any stack. No SDK signatures—pair with domain or provider skills when you need them. |

## Installation

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add sarvamai/skills

# Install a specific skill
npx skills add sarvamai/skills --skill sarvam-mcp
npx skills add sarvamai/skills --skill chat
npx skills add sarvamai/skills --skill vibe-coding

# Browse skills interactively
npx skills add sarvamai/skills --list
```

```bash
# Setup (SDK skills)
export SARVAM_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # get at dashboard.sarvam.ai
pip install sarvamai    # Python
npm install sarvamai    # JavaScript/TypeScript

# Setup (MCP skill — live tools in-chat)
# uvx sarvam-mcp  — see sarvam-mcp/references/install.md for each client
```

Works with **Cursor**, **Claude Code**, **Windsurf**, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). The MCP skill also covers Claude Desktop, Zed, Codex, Gemini CLI, VS Code, Cline, Continue, and LM Studio.

## How It Works

```
sarvam-mcp/SKILL.md     ← MCP routing (tools_* vs code_*) for any harness
SDK skill/SKILL.md       ← SDK signatures + gotchas (what agents get wrong)
    │
    ▼
llms.txt / MCP code_*    ← Always-fresh docs index or live API reference tools
    │
    ▼
Full API docs, OpenAPI spec, cookbooks, voice catalog, streaming protocols...
```

**sarvam-mcp** teaches agents when to call live MCP tools vs build-time helpers, and how to install the server in each client. The other Sarvam skills are a lean **correction layer** with both **Python** and **JavaScript/TypeScript** SDK snippets — only what AI agents get wrong when generating Sarvam AI code:

- **SDK call signatures** that differ from conventions (e.g., no `.create()` on chat)
- **Parameters that silently fail** (e.g., `output_script` ignored on sarvam-translate)
- **Parameters that error** (e.g., `pitch`/`loudness` returns 400 on Bulbul v3)
- **Non-trivial SDK patterns** (e.g., Batch API job chain, WebSocket async connect)

For everything else — full parameter tables, voice catalogs, language codes, rate limits, cookbook examples — the skill points to [llms.txt](https://docs.sarvam.ai/llms.txt), which is always up to date.
